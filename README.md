Automated patch-clamp electrophysiology analysis and visulaizations for current clamp recordings.

ephys_analysis automates data extraction of intrinsic properties such as input resistance and rheobase for multiple files at one time. Just put all your files into a folder and hit go on the program.

pF_Size_ephys_notes pulls out size and capacitance data from my notes.

Vis_f-I makes a floating plot of sweep traces for your ABF file.

abf_to_csv takes abf recordings and changes them to csv files for use with FIBSI analysis.

DSF_analysis analyzes output after running FIBSI.

AP_count_hDRG counts APs from abf files using IPFX.
